## Description
Bloomify is a web application for both novice and expert plant parents alike. It allows users to explore new plants & flowers and save plants they own, or want to own, to their 'sanctuary'. The application also provides a way to keep track of plant watering schedules. 

This application was created over 2 weeks, using React. 

## Features
Bloomify allows the user to search for plants and flowers, making use of the Perenual API to return relevant results. 

The user can search by keyword, or use the advanced search feature which allows them to search for plants based off of properties such as how much sunlight and watering they need.

The user can view in-depth descriptions and characteristics of each plant that the search returns. 

The user can then add plants to their 'Plant Sanctuary', to keep a log of plants that they own, or want to own. 

The watering log page gives the user a place to keep track of when their plants need watering. When they add a plant to water and corresponding date in the task list, it automatically populates the calendar. The user will also receive a pop-up reminder to water their plant(s) on the relevant days. The weather widget allows users to see current weather, to help them know if/when to water outdoor plants.

The settings page allows users to set their username and location, either using geolocation or via search input. This ensures a personalised experience for the user, with a persistent username. The weather widget will also display weather for their saved location. 

The Dashboard brings together all the features of Bloomify in one handy place, so the user can check on their plants in a quick glance.
